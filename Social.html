<h2 id="2">Regina Gyimesi - Ethics and Social Impact of Autonomous Vehicles</h2>
<p>
The rise of autonomy not only carries ethical issues but social implications, too. These two effects are very similar, but what I would like to focus on is the job market.</p>
    <div id="socialimg"><img src="stats.png" alt="job statistics"></div>
<p>There are two trends to be experienced, the continued need for tech skills and a growth in “human-centric” jobs, which rely on human qualities. At the bottom part, there is declination in the most repetitive tasks, which are more automatable. (Perisic, 2018) Automation can already be seen in supermarkets, factories but even in a few hotels. Machines are replacing cashiers, factory-workers or receptionists and soon self-driving cars will take the places of professional drivers. This will mainly affect the truck and taxi drivers, and from the two it is predicted that truck drivers will be the first to lose their jobs. Operating a taxi in the city, requires a higher level of human interaction and less autonomy, while driving on highways allows more autonomy; it is easier to follow the lane, there are no traffic lights, traffic jams or pedestrians. This is ideal for self-driving machines even at today’s development stage. The intensive automation will require different skills from displaced workers, it is claimed that the role of the truck drivers will shift to monitoring positions. Thus, the localization of the jobs is an interesting case; while truck drivers are mainly operating outside the city, the control centres are located in capital cities. (Bissel, 2018) Also, insurance companies should be taken into account regarding the loss of jobs as it is expected that car accidents will be less frequent.
<br>In conclusion, still many people require human assistance rather than the help of robots – seeking human company is in our nature. In the near future, AI will help humans perform tasks more efficiently, and while people’s jobs shift the transition into other (for example creative) roles could be made.
