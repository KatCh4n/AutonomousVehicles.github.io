<h2 id="2">Regina Gyimesi - Ethics and Social Impact of Autonomous Vehicles</h2>
<p>The history of ethics begins with ancient Greek philosophy followed by early English Positivists in the Medieval times of Europe. (ROGERS, 2015) Ethics generally defines the moral principles of human behaviour. The earliest idea of machine ethics -  “the moral behaviour of artificially intelligent beings” (Moor, 2006) - was expressed in science fiction author Isaac Asimov’s short story “Runaround” (1940). The three Robotics laws are “A robot may not injure a human being or, through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm.”, “A robot must obey the orders given it by human beings except where such orders would conflict with the First Law.” and “A robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with the First or Second Laws.”, respectively. (Asimov, n.d.) The first and second law protects the rights of humans and machines equally; a machine cannot kill a human and a human cannot harm a machine. The third law emphasizes the right for a robot to exist as long as it does not hurt others. Robots do not have rights as of yet, but soon the creator or the owner of the artificial intelligence will be held responsible for the robot’s actions. 
<br>In 2017 the first recorded driverless car accident happened in Arizona with an Uber self-driving car. The car was operating in self-driving mode with the backup driver sitting in the driving seat. (Vice, 2019) Who is responsible for the accident? There is no simple answer to that. There are a vast number of variables to take into consideration: human distraction, light measurement, road quality, speed. For self-driving cars, it is especially important to have a clear sight of the marked road and the pedestrian(s). Nowadays, every car is designed to protect the passenger, not the pedestrian. However, with a few further developments, the number of accidents could be reduced on the roads. A built-in breathalyzer or eye scanner would stop the driver if drunk or sleepy. “…we can use the automated functionality to take over the control if the driver is not fit to drive,” said Dr Anna Anund “What we would like to achieve is a safe and acceptable transition in order to avoid severe crashes with people being severely injured or even killed.” (Horizon: the EU Research & Innovation magazine, 2019)
<br>The first-ever human-self-driving machine accident leads to the urgency to discuss machine ethics in depth. In the following, a theoretical scenario will be discussed similar to the psychological thought experiment known as the “Trolley Problem”. (Foot, 1967)
</p><div id="ethicsimg"><img src="moralmachine.png" alt="moral machine"><img src="moralmachine2.png" alt="moral machine2"></div><p>In this case, the self-driving car has a sudden brake failure and it continues to go ahead and crash into the concrete barrier, or it will swerve and drive through the pedestrian. (Moral Machine, 2019) The exercise is useful just to see how hard is the decision to make in practice. The Moral Machine examines machine-made decisions in various situations. It takes into consideration the gender, age, the status of the pedestrian, whether it is a human or an animal or crossing on a red or green light. On one hand, all lives are created equal, on the other the fact that sparing the life of an old person over a young one would upset many people. If firms decide they would program an AI to prioritize young lives over others, it would still cause an ethical dilemma. However, as of yet, there is no sophisticated algorithm that can differentiate between young or old. I believe all ethical questions should be discussed with the public first and any actions taken towards development should be fully transparent. This way the public can trust the company and the machine itself.
<br>In conclusion the ethical questions of autonomous vehicles implicate no right or wrong answers. However, companies have to work on algorithms to try to cause the best possible outcomes for both occupants and pedestrian.
