<h2 id="1">Kat Chan - Automatic Cars</h2><p> I will be researching about autonomous cars and what they are all about: their specifications, how companies are adapting this new technology and where this new technology is being implemented.  Are they safer to drive than the standard petrol cars we know and use today? I will attempt my best to answer these types of questions within my two pages of the website that our group creates. Self-driving cars are slowly becoming the craze. With Tesla, Apple and Uber all trying to cross the 'auto car line', there seems to be a big award to who releases the first sustainable and suitable model. Autonomous cars edge towards the future, they show us what the world could be like if us humans start to implement avant-garde innovative technology and adapt a no emission behaviour, that's likely why many of the 'self-driving' cars are electricity powered. </p>
        <h2 id="2">Regina Gyimesi - Ethics and Social Impact</h2>
<p>In this topic ethical concerns, the problem of moral uncertainty and the social impact of autonomous vehicles are explored. The self-driving car making companies claim that the vehicles could reduce environmental pollution and reduce deaths on the road. However, many ethical issues arise. As the age of self-driving cars approaches there is an urgency to discuss these problems and their solutions. Inevitable scenarios similar to the “Trolley problem” are going to be discussed alongside how these machine ethics could be programmed when in fact there are no universal rules. Also, due to the rise of autonomous vehicles, many professional drivers will lose their jobs. This raises a social concern mainly about the truck and taxi drivers. It is going to be further studied how these jobs will be replaced, how it will create new jobs and what jobs are available now.</p>
<h2 id="3">Julia Currie - Current Developments and Challenges</h2>
<p>I will be researching the challenges researchers face while developing Artificial Intelligence for autonomous vehicles such as the difficulty in programming to account for any possible situation as well as the legality of its use. Up until 2014, the Convention on Road Traffic made autonomous vehicles illegal to be used in the countries, which signed the document in 1968. However, since the amendment, despite requiring the presence of a driver, steering can be carried out by an automatic system. Thus, paving the way for semi-autonomous cars to be used legally. However, developers are still struggling to program an AI that would be able to deal with all the complications of driving such as pedestrians, obstacles and other drivers and for it to react to situations in an ethical way.  I will also be researching the latest developments into artificial intelligence and autonomous vehicles including Ford’s plan to introduce a commercial transport service using autonomous vehicles in 2021, as well as the development of unmanned cargo ships.</p>
        <h2 id="4">Zuhayr Khan - Future Development</h2>
<p>I will be carrying out the research of future development in autonomous vehicles. Every year another major change is seen in this industry whether it is artificial intelligence, fuel efficiency or self-driving technology. The future of this industry is vast with ideas with many companies exploring their “futuristic” technology right now such as Tesla with their automated self-driving cars or Audi with their electric motors. These new features being built into these cars have many advantages, unfortunately there are some disadvantages being criticized by the public. I will be covering both sides of the story and exploring further into the future of autonomous vehicles.</p>
        <h2 id="5">Josh Millar - Levels of Autonomy</h2>
<p>I will be researching the levels of autonomous driving and how it affects users. Year by year, cars have become self-reliant machines requiring less and less human input. Currently, advanced car computers have level 2 autonomy, which means that 2 or more key elements are controlled by the computer, Mercedes cars have steering and braking controlled on their advanced cruise control system. However, we are rapidly approaching level 3 autonomy in cars, meaning cars will take full control of all key features of the cars and in some circumstances, drive themselves. However, the driver will still have to intervene. But what comes after this? Will humans soon become passengers to the vehicles the vehicles they had once driven? How will this impact fuel economy, congestion, road traffic incidents? Are we ready to put our lives in the hands of machines to take us from one place to the next?</p>
<h2 id="6">Paul Craig - Air and Aquatic Vehicles</h2>
<p>I will be researching the current use of autonomy in air and aquatic vehicles. Both types of vehicle allow for tasks to be performed without the risk of human life however they are also being used by militaries to put life's at risk and what else may it risk if it fails. There are 3 main types of autonomous air and aquatic vehicles, consumer, business and military and I will be looking at how the autonomy improves each individual sector separately. I will also be looking at expected future developments and what the current needed developments are.</p></div>
