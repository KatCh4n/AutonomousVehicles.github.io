            <h2>Electric Cars</h2>

<p>At the current time there is no surprise that ‘Tesla is at the forefront of the fuel-efficiency movement’ [The Future of Technology in the Automotive Industry]. Tesla have done an outstanding job in terms of releasing both hybrid and electric powered vehicles. They managed to reach extreme numbers of sales soaring up to 2 million worldwide back in 2016. Electric vehicles have been around for quite some time but the future is looking ever so more promising for them. You might assume that because these cars are so fuel efficient that the prices could be out of range, but it is the complete opposite. There are many brands making these efficient vehicles more up to an ordinary person’s standard with prices under £27,000. Sales of electric vehicles are expected to improve as time goes on, the United States are expected that 25% vehicle sales are electric by the time it hits 2030 whereas in China it is predicted to be 30%.</p>

    <h2>Artificial Intelligence</h2>

<p>Artificial intelligence has been a more recent thing to come to the market and even then it has not been used to its full potential. This is a huge future development project in terms of implementing this feature in cars worldwide. As well as artificial intelligence in vehicles, self-driving technology has been in multiple headlines since it was introduced. There is a divided community on whether or not they want to see self-driving cars in their neighbourhoods as they think it is a safety risk. ‘The proportion (57%) of connected car drivers in a recent survey who said they would not buy a self-driving car, even if cost was no issue.’ [Connected car drivers not keen on self-driving cars, finds survey] There is no doubt that in a few years’ time 1/5 cars you see will be self-driven. The same way adaptive cruise control, self-parking implementations, motorway sensors and mapping tech have sneaked its way into every other car the same way self-driving cars will enter our world.</p>

    <h2>Car Tyres</h2>

<p>One of the most crucial area of the car and the most looked after are the tyres. This is since the tyre increases the safety of the driver for when driving and braking. Tyres also make a huge impact on whatever the weather condition may be. In the winter time when roads becomes icy or maybe covered in snow, people need to upgrade their tyres into a suitable thread. This is done again to help with the stability of the car and to make sure that the driver is not at risk of skidding on the icy roads. However in the near future the trend of how car tyres are attached to cars is assumed to change. There is a plan to “connect” the tyres to the car for the use of collecting information on the road condition, this is spoke about by Goodyear’s director of technology programmes, Romain Hansen.<br><br>

“If the vehicle knows the composition of the tyre and how it performs, the ABS system can reduce stopping distances in all conditions,” says Hansen. Once this idea is implemented into cars, the car will be able to extract specific data of the road condition and the tyres will take effect. Goodyear’s TripleTube have released a concept of tyres which adapts in shape according to conditions, an example of this would be that the tyre pressure would increase to then increase a longer surface area which would then counter aquaplaning.</p>
