			<h2>Consumer</h2>
			<p>Autonomous aquatic vehicles are often referred to AUVs (Autonomous underwater vehicles). These AUV’s are being deployed for many different applications. These applications include mine sweeping, weld inspection, hull inspection, seawater sampling, wreck recovery and underwater surveying. One of the most versatile applications of these vehicles is the REMUS.<p>

<p>Reference:<a href="https://www2.whoi.edu/site/osl/vehicles/remus-6000-lars/">https://www2.whoi.edu/site/osl/vehicles/remus-6000-lars/</a></p><br>
            <p>The REMUS pictured above is deployed from a ship which has its installed launcher. From there an operator can give the remus a task. These tasks are often very lengthy for humans to undertake and involve an element of risk. These AUVs are so efficient that there has been reports that they can do a mine sweep of a 1 mile squared area in 16 hours where as a team of fivers would take 21 days. This efficiency as well as the ability to adapt most boats to allow for the launch of these AUV’s such as remus makes the technology very worth the cost of production and cost of continued research into the field. Although most of these applications seem to be for military applications exclusively these AUV’s are also being used in the oil and gas industry.<br>


The main use of the machines for the oil and gad industry is surveying. These machines can be used give an accurate map of what obstacles lay between a potential area for an oil rig and an oil well. It can also be applied to find the oil wells as well as identifying the obstacles. Due to the search and recover feature on the AUV’s they would also be able to recover any material that could disrupt the process in any manner. This overall would increase the efficiency of the process and reduce the risk of potential accidents. </p>
