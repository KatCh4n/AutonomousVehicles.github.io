			<!-- Paragraph about consumers use of autonomy -->
			<h2>Consumer</h2>
			<p>The main focus on autonomy for consumers is photography drones. These are typically small remote-controlled quadcopters which are equipped with cameras and allow users to capture images or video from an aerial view. These drones are often complex to control the movement of the drone and the movement of the camera at the same time. For this reason, many companies are making their drones partially autonomous and outfitting them with many features that will automatically perform tasks such as tracking targets for videos or for following a given path while the user is free to operate the camera. Many of these features allow for consumers to capture professional looking videos and pictures at a much cheaper price than equipment typically used in the film industry. The main application of autonomy is done by image recognition software. Images from the drone’s cameras and sensors are scanned to determine how the camera should be repositioned or how much power should be put into each propeller. A common concern is the invasion of privacy that these drones can be used for. This could effectively turn the drone into a fully automatic camera used for spying. A potential solution to this problem would be to prohibit the use of drones in non-public areas. The autonomy in these drones could even be used to stop the operator from flying in those areas.<p>

			<h2>Business</h2>
			<p>Multiple companies can use autonomous air vehicles for improving their business. The most widely implemented version of this would be auto pilot on commercial airlines. This autonomy never has complete control of the aircraft but instead assists the pilot in tasks such as flying straight without any changes in altitude (One of the first tasks to be automated on airplanes). Companies have since been slowly improving their auto pilot features to make their flights more efficient and safer. This provides for a more profitable business. Soon airlines will seek to use a more developed version of autopilot in which the pilot is there to step in when auto pilot goes wrong rather than for the auto pilot to assist the pilot.<br><br>Another now widely used implementation of automated drones is for surveying land. This can be used for geographic research or planning for a construction site. The drones can be automated to create a 3D map of a given area. The drones use sensors and cameras to create multiple projections of the ground, a topographical view or another possible view. This saves a lot of time as typically surveying land can be rather time consuming especially over large distances. One of the other advantages of using technology to survey the land in this manner is that it allows for surveying of land that is not accessible by foot. The automated drones could also be used for keeping track of animals within a certain geographical location without disturbing the animals. Drone’s automation will slowly improve to the point that they can overcome any problems that occur when taking images, such as an elevated object that blocks the drones view from certain angles.
<br><br>One use of drones that companies are currently looking into is using them to deliver packages. The idea being that drones can have packages attached to them and drop them off at your door or a designated collection point if specified. If implemented this would allow for faster deliveries and reduce the traffic on roads. The idea being that the drones would be completely autonomous and be able to handle any possible obstructions to their route. Common concerns of this implementation are that it would cause a lot of noise in congested areas. A possible solution to this is that drones would be able to communicate with other drones to know which areas have a lot of drones currently and so that they can reroute to avoid that area.<p>

			<h2>Military</h2>
			<p>Militaries have been using autonomous air vehicles for multiple reasons for a fair amount of time. They have been using Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) for reconnaissance to allow for better planning of potential conflicts. Autonomy has been implemented into bombing drones. These drones can be launched and travel to set destination without input other than a desired location. These drones have been used to stop terrorist cells before an attack. They have been used to aid troops during battle and they have been used to determine if a location or pathway is safe for transportation due to the multiple cameras they have equipped. There is a lot of disagreement in the use of these machines as they can cause a lot of collateral damage. This worry is only amplified with the knowledge that militaries are actively working on improving these drones to become more lethal. It is wondered if the drones will cause much more harm than good.<p>
