		<h2 id="5">Josh Millar - History of Autonomy</h2>

<p>Autonomous vehicles are not recent ideas, they have been planned and attempted from dates ranging back as far as the 1500's with Leonardo Da Vinci's self-propelled cart that people may consider to be "the world’s first robot". Then in 1925, soon after the beginning of mass-produced motorised vehicles, many began to ponder cars without drivers. One of these men was Francis Houdina, an American inventor. He made a radio-controlled car which could perform driving tasks and navigate through Manhattan without a driver present in the vehicle. However, it wasn’t until later in the 20th century that things really 'took off'. Mechanical Mike was born - an autopilot system for long-range aircraft, designed to help pilots who had to fly for many hours on end. For this, gyroscopes were implemented to maintain an accurate direction and to this day, they remain integral of many autopilot systems. The most current autopilot system is that implemented in Tesla cars as they now allow hands-free driving on major roads. Many current vehicles have some degree of autonomy, such as lane-assist or anti-crash features. The University of Michigan has built what they call MCity, a proving ground for automated vehicles. Here they test automated, autonomous and connected vehicles. Connected vehicles are those that “talk” to each other. This is a massive breakthrough as right now autonomous cars are very dependent on their cameras and visibility, meaning a lesser vision can be dangerous. These connected vehicles can communicate with like cars and the infrastructure surrounding them. This is done through a similar system to the wi-fi we would have in our homes as it’s a strong signal that can penetrate the many barriers it may face.</p>
